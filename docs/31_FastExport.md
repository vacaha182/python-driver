### FastExport

The driver offers FastExport, which opens multiple database connections to transfer data in parallel.

Please be aware that this is an early release of the FastExport feature. Think of it as a beta or preview version. It works, but does not yet offer all the features that JDBC FastExport offers. FastExport is still under active development, and we will continue to enhance it in subsequent builds.

FastExport has limitations and cannot be used in all cases as a substitute for SQL queries:
* FastExport cannot query a volatile table or global temporary table.
* FastExport supports single-statement SQL `SELECT`, and supports multi-statement requests composed of multiple SQL `SELECT` statements only.
* FastExport supports question-mark parameter markers in `WHERE` clause conditions. However, the database does not permit the equal `=` operator for primary or unique secondary indexes, and will return database error 3695 "A Single AMP Select statement has been issued in FastExport".
* Do not use FastExport to fetch only a few rows, because FastExport opens extra connections to the database, which is time consuming.
* Only use FastExport to fetch many rows (at least 100,000 rows) so that the row-fetching performance gain exceeds the overhead of opening additional connections.
* FastExport does not support all database data types. For example, `BLOB` and `CLOB` are not supported.
* For best efficiency, do not use `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses with FastExport.
* FastExport's result set ordering behavior may differ from a regular SQL query. In particular, a query containing an ordered analytic function may not produce an ordered result set. Use an `ORDER BY` clause to guarantee result set order.
* FastExport requires read access to the DBC.SessionInfoV view to obtain the database Logon Sequence Number of the FastExport job.

FastExport opens multiple data transfer connections to the database. FastExport uses overlapped I/O to send and receive messages in parallel.

To use FastExport, your application must prepend one of the following escape functions to the query:
* `{fn teradata_try_fastexport}` tries to use FastExport for the query, and automatically executes the query as a regular SQL query when the query is not compatible with FastExport.
* `{fn teradata_require_fastexport}` requires FastExport for the query, and fails with an error when the query is not compatible with FastExport.

Your application can prepend other optional escape functions to the query:
* `{fn teradata_sessions(`n`)}` specifies the number of data transfer connections to be opened, and is capped at the number of AMPs. The default is the smaller of 8 or the number of AMPs. We recommend avoiding this function to let the driver ask the database how many data transfer connections should be used.
* `{fn teradata_govern_on}` or `{fn teradata_govern_off}` specifies whether Teradata workload management rules may delay or reject the FastExport. Takes precedence over the `govern` connection parameter.

After beginning a FastExport, your application can obtain the Logon Sequence Number (LSN) assigned to the FastExport by prepending the following escape functions to the query:
* `{fn teradata_nativesql}{fn teradata_logon_sequence_number}` returns the string form of an integer representing the Logon Sequence Number (LSN) for the FastExport. Returns an empty string if the request is not a FastExport.
