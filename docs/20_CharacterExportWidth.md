### Character Export Width

The driver always uses the UTF8 session character set, and the `charset` connection parameter is not supported. Be aware of the database's *Character Export Width* behavior that adds trailing space padding to fixed-width `CHAR` data type result set column values when using the UTF8 session character set.

The database `CHAR(`_n_`)` data type is a fixed-width data type (holding _n_ characters), and the database reserves a fixed number of bytes for the `CHAR(`_n_`)` data type in response spools and in network message traffic.

UTF8 is a variable-width character encoding scheme that requires a varying number of bytes for each character. When the UTF8 session character set is used, the database reserves the maximum number of bytes that the `CHAR(`_n_`)` data type could occupy in response spools and in network message traffic. When the UTF8 session character set is used, the database appends padding characters to the tail end of `CHAR(`_n_`)` values smaller than the reserved maximum size, so that the `CHAR(`_n_`)` values all occupy the same fixed number of bytes in response spools and in network message traffic.

Work around this drawback by using `CAST` or `TRIM` in SQL `SELECT` statements, or in views, to convert fixed-width `CHAR` data types to `VARCHAR`.

Given a table with fixed-width `CHAR` columns:

`CREATE TABLE MyTable (c1 CHAR(10), c2 CHAR(10))`

Original query that produces trailing space padding:

`SELECT c1, c2 FROM MyTable`

Modified query with either `CAST` or `TRIM` to avoid trailing space padding:

`SELECT CAST(c1 AS VARCHAR(10)), TRIM(TRAILING FROM c2) FROM MyTable`

Or wrap query in a view with `CAST` or `TRIM` to avoid trailing space padding:

`CREATE VIEW MyView (c1, c2) AS SELECT CAST(c1 AS VARCHAR(10)), TRIM(TRAILING FROM c2) FROM MyTable`

`SELECT c1, c2 FROM MyView`

This technique is also demonstrated in sample program `CharPadding.py`.
