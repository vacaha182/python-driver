### CSV Batch Inserts

The driver can read batch insert bind values from a CSV (comma separated values) file. This feature can be used with SQL batch inserts and with FastLoad.

To specify batch insert bind values in a CSV file, the application prepends the escape function `{fn teradata_read_csv(`*CSVFileName*`)}` to the `INSERT` statement.

The application can specify batch insert bind values in a CSV file, or specify bind parameter values, but not both together. The driver returns an error if both are specified together.

Considerations when using a CSV file:
* Each record is on a separate line of the CSV file. Records are delimited by line breaks (CRLF). The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line break.
* The first line of the CSV file is a header line. The header line lists the column names separated by the field separator (e.g. `col1,col2,col3`).
* The field separator defaults to the comma character (`,`). You can specify a different field separator character with the `field_sep` connection parameter or with the `teradata_field_sep` escape function. The specified field separator character must match the actual separator character used in the CSV file.
* Each field can optionally be enclosed by the field quote character, which defaults to the double-quote character (e.g. `"abc",123,efg`). You can specify a different field quote character with the `field_quote` connection parameter or with the `teradata_field_quote` escape function. The field quote character must match the actual field quote character used in the CSV file.
* The field separator and field quote characters cannot be set to the same value. The field separator and field quote characters must be legal UTF-8 characters and cannot be line feed (`\n`) or carriage return (`\r`).
* Field quote characters are only permitted in fields enclosed by field quote characters. Field quote characters must not appear inside unquoted fields (e.g. not allowed `ab"cd"ef,1,abc`).
* To include a field quote character in a quoted field, the field quote character must be repeated (e.g. `"abc""efg""dh",123,xyz`).
* Line breaks, field quote characters, and field separators may be included in a quoted field (e.g. `"abc,efg\ndh",123,xyz`).
* Specify a `NULL` value in the CSV file with an empty value between commas (e.g. `1,,456`).
* A zero-length quoted string specifies a zero-length non-`NULL` string, not a `NULL` value (e.g. `1,"",456`).
* Not all data types are supported. For example, `BLOB`, `BYTE`, and `VARBYTE` are not supported.
* A field length greater than 64KB is transmitted to the database as a `DEFERRED CLOB` for a SQL batch insert. A field length greater than 64KB is not supported with FastLoad.

Limitations when using CSV batch inserts:
* Bound parameter values cannot be specified in the execute method when using the escape function `{fn teradata_read_csv(`*CSVFileName*`)}`.
* The CSV file must contain at least one valid record in addition to the header line containing the column names.
* For FastLoad, the insert operation will fail if the CSV file is improperly formatted and a parser error occurs.
* For SQL batch insert, some records may be inserted before a parsing error occurs. A list of the parser errors will be returned. Each parser error will include the line number (starting at line 1) and the column number (starting at zero).
* Using a CSV file with FastLoad has the same limitations and is used the same way as described in the [FastLoad](#FastLoad) section.
