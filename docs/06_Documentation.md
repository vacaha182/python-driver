### Documentation

When the driver is installed, the `README.md` file is placed in the `teradatasql` directory under your Python installation directory. This permits you to view the documentation offline, when you are not connected to the Internet.

The `README.md` file is a plain text file containing the documentation for the driver. While the file can be viewed with any text file viewer or editor, your viewing experience will be best with an editor that understands Markdown format.
